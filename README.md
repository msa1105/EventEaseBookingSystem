### üîß 1. Full Feature List

The *EventEase* system is a cloud-enabled event booking platform that enables staff to manage venues, events, and client bookings. Key features include:

* **Venue Management**: Create, edit, view, and delete venues, including uploading images to Azure Blob Storage.
* **Event Management**: CRUD operations on events, linked to venues, with image support.
* **Booking System**: Users can make bookings for events, with validation to prevent double-booking.
* **Event Type Categorisation**: Events can be filtered by predefined event types.
* **Advanced Filtering**: Users can filter events by date range, event type, and venue availability.
* **Azure Blob Storage Integration**: Upload and serve images through a secure, scalable storage service.
* **Azure SQL Database**: Used to persist all system data including users, venues, events, and bookings.
* **Responsive, Dark-Themed UI**: Mobile-friendly and styled with Razor + CSS.
* **Deployment to Azure Web App**: Live web app accessible on the internet.

### üß© 2. Component & Azure Services Discussion

#### ‚öô Azure Web App (Hosting)

Used to deploy and host the ASP.NET Core MVC web application. This service was selected for its seamless GitHub integration, auto-scaling support, and built-in diagnostics.

**Alternative Considered**: I briefly considered Azure Static Web Apps, but due to the need for server-side logic and database integration, Azure Web App was a better fit.

#### üóÉ Azure SQL Database (Persistent Data Store)

Used to store relational data for all entities: `Venue`, `Event`, `Booking`, and `EventType`. It ensured ACID-compliant transactions and easy integration with Entity Framework Core.

**Alternative**: Azure Cosmos DB was considered for its global distribution and NoSQL capabilities, but since the data was relational, SQL Database was the better choice.

#### üìÇ Azure Blob Storage (Media Handling)

Used to upload and serve venue/event images via public URLs. A custom service (`BlobService.cs`) manages file uploads.

**Alternative**: Filesystem storage on the server was a non-scalable option. Blob Storage offers durability and is production-ready for media files.

#### üî® GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Used for continuous deployment to Azure Web App directly from GitHub repository. It reduced manual deployment effort and ensured up-to-date production environments.

### üíª 3. Technologies Used and Justification

* **ASP.NET Core MVC**: Ideal for rapid web development with clear separation of concerns.
* **Entity Framework Core**: Simplified database interaction using code-first approach and migrations.
* **Azure SQL**: Hosted relational database with minimal configuration needed.
* **Azure Blob Storage**: Used for managing media files externally, improving performance.
* **HTML/CSS**: Used to craft a sleek, dark-themed, responsive UI.
* **Visual Studio / GitHub**: IDE and version control platform used throughout the project.
* **JavaScript (Lightweight)**: Used in views for validation and dynamic UI elements.

### üìñ 4. Full Project Reflection (Part 1 ‚Üí Part 3)

From the initial phase of setting up basic CRUD functionality to fully deploying the EventEase system on Azure, this project has been a transformational learning experience.

In **Part 1**, I laid the foundation with system analysis and design tasks like ERD design, use cases, and interface mockups. This phase taught me the value of planning and stakeholder-based thinking.

In **Part 2**, I translated those designs into a working web application. This was the first time I integrated image uploading using Azure Blob Storage, implemented custom business logic like booking validations, and began deploying to the cloud. Debugging real-time deployment issues pushed me to understand cloud environments much better.

In **Part 3**, I enhanced the system‚Äôs usability with advanced filtering, added an `EventType` table, and polished the application for final deployment. I also dealt with data relationships more deeply and encountered issues like double foreign key mappings, which helped me strengthen my Entity Framework and SQL skills.

Overall, I gained practical, hands-on experience in:

* Designing and modeling real-world systems
* Developing full-stack web applications
* Deploying to a cloud platform with service integration
* Debugging and managing a production app
* Applying Agile-style incremental development

### üßæ 5. Conclusion

The EventEase project gave me a real taste of professional development, far beyond the classroom. It taught me that building modern applications means much more than writing code ‚Äî it‚Äôs about architecting reliable systems, understanding cloud platforms, working with databases, and delivering a product that users can trust.

Every Azure service used was not just chosen out of necessity, but for its scalability, reliability, and alignment with enterprise standards. With each service ‚Äî Web App, SQL Database, Blob Storage ‚Äî I learned how to balance configuration with performance and security.

This project was not just a university assignment ‚Äî it was a complete development experience that will shape how I build software in the future.
